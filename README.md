# Image-Search-Engine
This project demonstrates how to build a fully functional Image Search Engine using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input a search term, and the app will fetch and display images in real-time from an external API such as Unsplash or Pexels. The project explores the integration of third-party APIs, managing asynchronous requests with JavaScript's fetch() method, and handling JSON data.
